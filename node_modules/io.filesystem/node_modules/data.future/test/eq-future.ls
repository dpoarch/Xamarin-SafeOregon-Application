#
# Tests if an Future monad is equal to another Future monad.
#  
# Equality with pending futures is only decidable if the computation
# of both futures can be resolved synchronously. Otherwise this
# function will return false.
#
# **WARNING:** this is a partial function, it'll only work for
# futures representing synchronous actions.
